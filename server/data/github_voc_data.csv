- On icon click, default to copy icon name instead of svg, or give options

## Why
- I doubt designers or developers would be using the website to copy svgs regularly.
- Use case 1: Designers will likely use figma or sketch to get the icons in the correct frame size, etc
- Use case 2: UI developers would likely use the npm library, and icon names would make the most sense
- Use case 3: Self hosters would likely use a bulk import, using a zip containing all icons rather than one at a time.
- Use case 4: Users on other programs / use cases not as popular will likely require bulk import, and get the icons via the zip as well.
