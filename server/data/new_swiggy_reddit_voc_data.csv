1,swiggy,https://www.reddit.com/r/swiggy/comments/r6bu6d/swiggy_super_is_a_scam/,Swiggy Super is a scam.,"I bought Swiggy Super 1 month subscription. The minimum order amount for free delivery was â‚¹149. Few days later they say they have upgraded Swiggy Super to Swiggy One with Swiggy One having minimum order amount as â‚¹199 for free delivery. Why the hell would I have to order for â‚¹199 to avail free discount when you said it is â‚¹149 while I was paying. Pasting their response to my complaint below:

Hi,

I donâ€™t want to be upgraded to Swiggy One. Please revert my subscription back to Swiggy Super, I donâ€™t want to order food for â‚¹199 to avail free delivery. 
I donâ€™t care about the extra 1 month you gave me. I just want to order for â‚¹149 and get free delivery, thatâ€™s what I signed up for.

Thanks. 


Hi <my_name>, 

Greetings from Swiggy. 

Unfortunately, we have discontinued the Super Plan and launched the new Swiggy One program with more benefits. Hence, we will be unable to proceed with extending Super benefits.

This is to inform you about the new Swiggy One program. The Swiggy One membership program offers unlimited free delivery* from participating restaurants (on orders above INR 149/199) as well as free delivery* from Instamart (on orders above INR 99). Swiggy One members will also get exclusive extra discounts over and above regular offers on select restaurants and will not be charged surge fees.

The Swiggy One membership is available on the latest version of your Swiggy app.

* Not applicable on long-distance orders.

Please feel free to contact us, if you require further assistance at www.swiggy.com/support.

Warm Regards,
Shahbaz Alam

Now when i buy one on one offer , the price is ridiculous it surpasses even with the amount in account with no super . One item is 20 rs in normal account but as soon as i see it in my super account it says 50 rs. WoW what a technique by restaurant owners. Now i feel cheated by swiggy. Next time i will not fall such scam.

So we live in a mountain in the heart of a Town somewhere in India... People often get lost here in this mountain, but the location is marked right.... One day there was no gas in cylinder so we had to resort to Swiggy, and we ordered like everyone else.
The thing that really bugged me is that the delivery guy told me never to order from this location again.(although many delivery guy came here before) My mind was already tired because of work so i said ""Okay, I will see.... it depends on me"" and tried to end it there.... he said again ""Don't order from here"" .... I replied ""Okay, Dekhta (I will see)"" to avoid conflict after a tiring day.... and he went back.... pretty normal till now right?
Now I thought i could move on after this event... But tbh i couldnt...
Sometimes I look back overthinking the past for no particular reason. While one part of me saying ""I could have handled this better by saying stuff like, Hey you see your delivery location, dont accept it then"" while the other part tells me ""You have successfully evaded conflict for this petty reason""
I told 2 of my friends about it and their reply was complete opposite.... What do you guyz think? Should I have been more aggressive towards him or what i did was right?
